      To be honest, I walk because my armpits flutter <br />
      I walk because I’m ashamed of my huge wings <br />
      I walk because my bird house is smaller than me

      Shirley Temple, cry for us,<br />
      and Shirley Temple cried. The first<br />
      word of no baby is “Hello,” how <br />
      strange. The baby believes, “I was here <br />
      before you, learning to wave just <br />
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;like the Atlantic.”

      “What of it, if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom
      and sweep down the decks? What does that indignity amount to, weighed, I
      mean, in the scales of the New Testament?"

      "We had quarrelled, he and I. But a quarrel, even if you never see someone
      again, is nothing, nothing more than a different way of living together,
      without losing contact, in the narrow little world which is given us. It
      did not stop me from thinking of him, from being aware of his eye on the
      page of the book or the newspaper he was reading, and from asking myself:
      “What does he think of it? What does he think of it at this moment?"

      I am the heart now, head bowed in service<br />
      to the gasp of cool air sweeping my feet from under me, <br />
      I am tangle of swinging arms and legs
    </p>

    <p>
      in pendulum swing, a sweeping knot <br />
      with no duty to uphold but to never meet their eyes; <br />
      I am to take in the ceiling, the speakers, their shoes.
