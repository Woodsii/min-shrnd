    I like working on a lot of things, so i'll put some of the things that im
    most proud of here.

    I've been thinking a lot of what it means to be an expert in the field of
    computer science (probably going to merit it's own blog post), and the
    merits of it today.

    TLDR for now: I want to have that kind of easy expertise that the
    programmers pre-LLM, pre-google, pre-stack exchange had. And I think that
    comes from narrowing my focus as a programmer (Thoreau says simplify your
    affairs). So finding my area, my language(s) that im going to take into my
    career will probably take up a decent chunk of these projects for a bit lol.
