      My roomate came into my room, as he often does, and struck up a
      conversation about the idea of information overload, his area of research
      for his Science Technnology & Society degree. And we got to talking about
      it, the concept of how throughout the middle ages, people thought there
      were too many books.
    </p>

    <p>
      Especially with the introduction of the printing press, there was an
      influx of writing on every topic. The idea of the renaissance man pushed
      intellectuals to read everything, develop novel systems of processing and
      accessing (mentally and physically) that knowledge. But the torrent of
      writing doesn't stop, and people fell behind, experienced information
      overload.
    </p>

    <p>
      And so our conversation moved to the modern day, specifically in the field
      of computer science. How can we as programmers feel anything other than
      overwhelmed?
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking at our fore-fathers, the punch-card programmers, the computer
      enthusiasts, the start of silicon valley, how did they do it? How did they
      understand their field? How did they become masters of their domain
      without google, without stack overflow, without anything else?
    </p>

    <p>
      The answer that we settled on was that their focus was narrow. They stuck
      to one thing and organically developed their skills. Or maybe thats was
      our mythologized conception of them. Regardless, the access to information
      was significantlly limited back then.
    </p>

    <p>
      I heard in one of my classes that computer geeks in the early days met up
      and just tried to one up each other. They got their hands on the best
      consumer grade parts, in magazines or from word of mouth. Then they just
      got together and showed off their skills. What programs they had designed.
      What hardware they got running, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
      Today, programmers (especially students and beginners) are thrust into
      information overload; We have a paralyzing amount of information at our
      hands. There are million pathways ahead of us: what do you want to do? Oh
      web dev? What framework? What language? Are you fullstack?
    </p>

    <p>
      So what can you do? Henry David Thoreau says "let your affairs be as two
      or three, and not a hundred or a thousand; instead of a million count half
      a dozen". But my brain has a bad habit of turning me into renaissance man;
      I want to do it all: writing, drawing, music, electrical engineering,
      backend, frontend, AI engineering, etc. etc. etc. But a choice has to be
      made.
    </p>

    <p>
      So I am setting out to find out what that is. I do enjoy a lot of things
      that I want to do. I like web dev. I like AI/ML work. I like embeded
      systems/systems design. But I want to chose one. Which will, ironically,
      look a whole lot like the same scattered effort in the comming weeks or
      months. I'll play around until I settle on what it is. All this
      information doesn't have to be a bad thing, I can use to find that one
      rabit hole to throw myself down. Wish me luck!
