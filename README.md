# Minimal Secret Handshake RnD

My summer project of making a kickass, modern and schnazzy website with the domain im paying for is on hold. Senior year of college has its teeth in me. So instead, im going to make an as-small-as-possible website with as minimal tech as possible, inspired by the great work of everyone on 512KB Club. Hopefully I make it to the green club!
