      I was hanging out with some friends yesterday,
        watching a Japanese yaoi rom com when the folds
        in my brain scrunched up, raisin tight, and produced an
        image. An image of freshly baked baguettes, steaming hot when
        cracked open. I had to make them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Growing up, my mom made a lot of bread. It was the closest thing
        that we ever got to white bread in my house. She had
        this hulking bread maker for more than 10
        years. It lived on the countertop, shaking it
        as it worked. It whooped, crying under
        the strain of kneading the dough;
        it screamed like our lives are in
        danger when a loaf was done. She'd extract
        the loaves from its jaws, hot-potato tapping
        the underside of the loaves and listening for
        the hollow ring of a well-baked loaf.
        I'll go home
        to Illinois, and there'll be dough
        churning away in the machine and the hallmark chlorine
        smell of my mom's bread floating in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Camden, my older brother, got fancy with it
        though. He's always been <em>the </em>baker. When my nana died,
        he labored over a cast iron press, churning
        out pizzelle. He spent one of his
        winter breaks between video games and crafting
        the perfect cinnamon rolls. Whenever he was home, there was
        always something delicious around, including baguettes. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Camden was to baguettes as Sisyphus was to the boulder. It was
        his white whale. In his post-grad, pre-graduate
        program funk, working in online tutoring, he
        made those damn baguettes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second time he made baguettes, he
        had already nailed them. But
        it wasn't good enough
        for him. He labored and toiled, thrifted
        and scrounged in search of the platonically
        ideal baguettes. If my mom's baking is like driving a minivan,
        Camden's is like designing the car. He did his work in sterile
        conditions, no sound except the rhythmic slap of kneading: one, two,
        rotate. One, two, rotate. With practiced movements, he'd check
        the gluten development, roll the dough into perfect baguettes, score,
        and place in the oven. Out they'd come, golden
        and cracking. Sitting down to make my
        own baguettes felt like the
        start of a personal moonshot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Getting started felt less like cooking and more
        like becoming a single parent. When working with yeast, I
        put the weight of their lives on
        my mind. I've always been more of
        a cookies and cakes and pies guy, not
        a grizzled bread maker. It felt like skydiving.
        I don't know the first thing about how to fold a
        parachute or what the correct way to fall
        is or even when to pull my chute. But everyone
        can jump, so that's what I did. 
    </p>
    <p>
      The recipe simply said: "bloom the yeast". I
        had set my kettle to boil but was struck with a premonition of my
        yeast being cooked alive. I spent 10 minutes in a three-way
        tango with the sink and the kettle. Camden would have prepared the
        perfect bed for the yeast to rise. Even my mom would have no trouble
        with her wonderful machine. They got
        magic while I'm stuck
        with a wet finger and anxiety about hot water yeast
        murder. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Camden's ritual was clinical: hydrate, autolyze, fold;
        it was a hard science. In my hands, it felt like wrestling a
        swamp creature. The recipe called for a gentle "stretch and fold," a
        rhythmic "up, over, rotate" that was supposed to build structure.
        Instead, the dough clung to me with the desperation of a needy toddler.
        I spent three hours picking dough off my hands, hair, and
        clothes, trying to mimic Camden's sterile precision in a kitchen
        that was bordering on condemned. There was no rhythmic
        slap of kneading here, just the clattering of the bowl and the
        splattering of dough as I wrestled. It felt like
        crashing his car. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shaping them wasn't easy
        either. Copying Camden's refined rolling techniques
        fell flat when pushing my "baguettes" through
        a mountain of flour. They stuck to everything: my hands, the
        counter, the pan. My roommate Emily walked in on me up to my
        wrists in a glutenous sludge, bent over the counter and
        flapping at the faucet handle with my elbows. She kindly
        turned the sink on, put her earbuds back in, and went back to
        her omelet without a word. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pulling the baguettes out of the oven didn't change
        much. They were pale, and just as lumpy
        and small -- my hope for any
        oven spring deflated. But tapping the
        bottom yielded that clear, hollow sound, like knocking on an
        expensive door. Despite how thin they got, their crumb
        was wonderful. Paired with bear-bottle honey and fresh butter,
        their warmth spread down to my toes. Zach got off the
        couch and came and devoured a hot baguette with me in a flurry
        of butter and honey. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Camden did a number on me
        though: I was possessed by his perfectionist spirit.
        For 2 weeks after my little turd-baguettes, I filled our apartment up
        with loaves of bread. I switched to an even easier recipe. No knead, no
        fold, but just as sticky and gloopy. Dumping the dough
        onto the pan felt
        like littering; it slumped into a blob of
        slime. A delicious, crusty and fluffy blob, but
        a pile of refuse none the less.
    </p>
    <p>
      Those loaves emerged from the oven tree-bark dark
        and slouched on the pan. After enough tapping and dreaming of the
        crumb, I'd slice them open, steam rising lazily from their
        exposed guts, and my roommates would come flocking like a
        group of hungry seagulls. They ignored my protests of
        "letting it sit for a second" and would rip and tear at
        it, cutting at it with butter knives. We devolved in
        those moments, standing around the oven, devouring
        my fresh, warm bread. 
    </p>
    <p>
      When pulling a loaf out, our glasses would fog, the
        greediest would burn their fingertips on the
        bread and swear, and we would laugh at them while
        stuffing chunks into our mouths anyway. Crumbs
        dusted the stovetop, our shirts, the floor. We danced around
        the flour, tracking ghostly footprints on the tile. We hovered
        around the oven like we were warming ourselves at a fire
        we didn't know we had been cold without.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, Zach pulled out a bespoke Nutella for
        us. Dan, who is famous for disappearing, threw a
        movie on TV. Emily cleared the counter, moving
        pizza boxes and the stack of the previous tenants' mail,
        making space like it mattered. We didn't talk about it.
        We just moved around each other; a choreography no one
        had taught us. The bread crackled as it cooled, a quiet and living
        sound. We all leaned in to listen, like it was telling us
        something.
    </p>
    <p>
      Standing over each new loaf didn't turn us into bakers,
        but it turned us into a household. Zach started cooking Indian food
        for us; Emily started brewing beer. But mostly, we just stopped
        disappearing into our rooms. We sit in the kitchen now.
        We watch the steam rise.
