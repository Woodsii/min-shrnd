    But by the time he was a young adult, he was an atheist. I understand those
    who protest that some countries have weapons that others do not. This
    tolerance is essential for religion to thrive, but it is being challenged in
    many different ways. It's a faith in other people, and it's what brought me
    here today. King's birthday at his home church, Ebenezer Baptist, in
    Atlanta. America, we are better than these last eight years. Each nation
    gives life to this principle in its own way, grounded in the traditions of
    its own people. It is easier to start wars than to end them. More to do for
    the father that I met who was losing his job and choking back the tears,
    wondering how he would pay $4,500 a month for the drugs his son needs
    without the health benefits that he counted on. We can play Reverend
    Wright's sermons on every channel, every day and talk about them from now
    until the election, and make the only question in this campaign whether or
    not the American people think that I somehow believe or sympathize with his
    most offensive words. In the face of that young student who sleeps just
    three hours before working the night shift, I think about my mom, who raised
    my sister and me on her own while she worked and earned her degree; who once
    turned to food stamps but was still able to send us to the best schools in
    the country with the help of student loans and scholarships. "And as we
    walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot
    turn back." Many Gulf States have enjoyed great wealth as a consequence of
    oil, and some are beginning to focus it on broader development. They saw
    that I knew the Scriptures and that many of the values I held and that
    propelled me in my work were values they shared. But it also means binding
    our particular grievances - for better health care, and better schools, and
    better jobs - to the larger aspirations of all Americans - the white woman
    struggling to break the glass ceiling, the white man whose been laid off,
    the immigrant trying to feed his family. Thank you. And may God's peace be
    upon you.
