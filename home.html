      At the time of Giannandrea’s hiring, the move was considered an admission
      from Apple that its current AI efforts were lackluster and needing
      revamping, evidenced by Siri falling far behind Google Assistant and
      Amazon’s Alexa in sophistication and industry adoption. Despite Siri
      living inside every iPhone and arriving on the scene before any other
      major voice assistant, Amazon and Google have led the race in consumer AI
      by incorporating their respective assistants into smart home products, a
      sector where Apple has lagged due to its stricter stances on user privacy
      and its delayed entrance to the smart speaker market.

      The same evolution took place with Amazon Web Services, the company’s
      cloud computing subsidiary. It launched in 2006 as a "data storage
      service," but it has since become indispensable to modern tech companies —
      as necessary as paper clips once were but a damn sight more profitable. So
      many companies rely on Amazon’s services that when the industry grows, AWS
      does, too. Last year, AWS alone made more money than McDonald’s. AWS is
      quite possibly the future of Amazon, which explains why it was everywhere
      at re:MARS.
